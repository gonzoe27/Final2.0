Hello and Welcome to my Final project!
I haved made a website that will show the users the libary Zoe and Bella have made over time 
There will be 3 main pages. 1. wil be the main page displaying a shelf with the welcomee message. 2. A page with Bella's libary hidden behind a personality quiz and Zo's Comic book recommendations of the month!

There are two different Databases implemented in this project one integrated into the program. One called Books where it has book information ranging from author to ratings. The second one Comics db where that is storing information about the comics 

There is a personality quiz where you will be able to get a book recommened to you based on your post apocoliptic likings.
